<b>Herpes Stromal Keratitis erodes the establishment of
tissue-resident memory T cell pool in HSV-1 infected corneas  </b><br>
<b>Introduction</b><br>
The recurrent herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection of the cornea can cause the development<br>
of herpes stromal keratitis (HSK). This chronic immunoinflammatory condition is a major cause<br>
of infection-induced vision loss. The previous episodes of HSK increase the risk of future<br>
recurrences in the same cornea. However, not all HSV-1 infected corneas that shed infectious<br>
virus at the ocular surface develop HSK, suggesting that corneal HSV-1 infection may cause an<br>
establishment of protective immunity in HSV-1 infected corneas. However, upon recurrent<br>
corneal HSV-1 infection, the established protective immunity can get compromised, resulting in<br>
the development of HSK. In this study, we compared the quantity and quality of tissue-resident<br>
memory T (T RM ) cells in HSV-1 infected corneas that did or did not develop HSK. Our results<br>
showed the predominance of T RM cell in the epithelium than in stroma of HSV-1 infected corneas.<br>
Furthermore, HSV-1 infected non-HSK corneas exhibited more CD4 and CD8 T RM cells than<br>
HSK corneas. The T RM cells in non-HSK than in HSK corneas was more effective in clearing the<br>
infectious virus upon secondary corneal HSV-1 infection. Our results demonstrate the differential<br>
quantity and quality of T RM cells in HSV-1 infected corneas that did or did not develop HSK.<br>
